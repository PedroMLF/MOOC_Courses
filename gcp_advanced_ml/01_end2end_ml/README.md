# End-to-End Machine Learning with Tensorflow on GCP

## Week 1

### Effective ML

To build effective ML you need:
- Big Data (implying batching and distribution).
- Feature Engineering (mostly due to human insights).
- Model Architectures (appropriate to the problem at hands).

### Fully managed ML

- Prototyping done with jupyer. Scaling done with GCP.
- ML Engine deals with distributing the training, scaling the number of machines necessary to make predictions, hyperparameter tuning, etc.

### Explore the dataset

- The most common types of models use tabular data.

### BigQuery

- BigQuery is a serverless data warehouse.
- Queries written using SQL 2011.
- Many ways to ingest, transform, load, and export data.
